  <h2 class='c012'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>The</span> National Shakespeare Memorial Committee,
it is announced, is about to produce
a new play by Mr. Bernard Shaw entitled
“The Dark Lady of the Sonnets.” Fourteen
years ago, provoked by the nonsense Mr.
Shaw was then writing about Shakespeare
in <i>The Saturday Review</i>, I wrote some articles
on Shakespeare in the same paper, in which
I showed in especial that Hamlet was a good
portrait of Shakespeare, for the master had
unconsciously pictured Hamlet over again as
Macbeth and Jaques, Angelo, Orsino, Lear,
Posthumus, Prospero and other heroes.
With admirable quickness Mr. Bernard Shaw
proceeded to annex as much of this theory of
mine as he thought important; in preface after
preface to his plays, notably in the preface to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>“Man and Superman,” he took my discovery
and used it as if it were his. For instance, he
wrote:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“He (Shakespeare) must be judged by those
characters into which he puts what he knows
of himself, his Hamlets and Macbeths and
Lears and Prosperos.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And again:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“All Shakespeare’s projections of the
deepest humanity he knew have the same
defect”—and so forth and so on.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the preface to “Three Plays for Puritans”
Mr. Shaw gave me a casual mention, just
sufficient to afford him a fig-leaf, so to
speak, of covering if the charge of plagiarism
were brought against him: “His (Shakespeare’s)
genuine critics,” he wrote, “from
Ben Jonson to Mr. Frank Harris, have always
kept as far on this side idolatry as I.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Six or seven years ago I wrote a play called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>“Shakespeare and his Love,” which was
accepted by Mr. Beerbohm Tree. As Mr.
Tree did not produce the play at the time
agreed upon, I withdrew it. Some time
afterwards, on the advice of a friend, I sent it
to the Vedrenne-Barker management. They
read it; but Mr. Barker, I was told, did not
like the part of Shakespeare. I wrote, therefore,
asking for the return of the play. Mr.
Vedrenne, in reply, told me that he admired
the play greatly, and still hoped to induce Mr.
Barker to play it. He asked me, therefore, to
leave it with him. A little while later I met
Mr. Shaw in the street; he told me that he,
too, had read my play which I had sent to the
Court managers, and added, “you have represented
Shakespeare as sadder than he was, I
think; but you have shown his genius, which
everyone else has omitted to do....”</p>

<p class='c003'>Last year I published a book entitled <i>The</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span><i>Man Shakespeare</i>, which was in essence an
amplification of my articles in <i>The Saturday
Review</i>. A considerable portion of this book had
been in print ten years. The work had a certain
success in England and America. This year I
have published in <i>The English Review</i> a series
of articles on <i>The Women of Shakespeare</i>, which
one of the first of living writers has declared
marks an epoch in English criticism.</p>

<p class='c003'>Now Mr. Shaw has written a play on the
subject, which I have been working on for
these fifteen years, and from what he has said
thereon in <i>The Observer</i> it looks as if he had
annexed my theory bodily so far as he can
understand it, and the characters to boot.
After talking about his play and Shakespeare’s
passion, and using words of mine again and
again as if they were his own, he acknowledges
his indebtedness to me in this high-minded
and generous way:</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>“The only English writer who has really
grasped this part of Shakespeare’s story is
Frank Harris; but Frank sympathises with
Shakespeare. It is like seeing Semele reduced
to ashes and sympathising with Jupiter.”</p>

<p class='c003'>This is equivalent to saying that all the
other parts of Shakespeare’s story have been
grasped by someone else, presumably by Mr.
Shaw himself, and not by me. It is as if Mr.
Cook had said, “the only American who really
knows anything about Polar exploration is
Captain Peary, though he uses his knowledge
quite stupidly.” One can imagine that such
testimony from such an authority would have
been very grateful to Captain Peary.</p>

<p class='c003'>This precious utterance of Mr. Shaw shows
further that in his version of the story he is
going to take the side of Mary Fitton against
Shakespeare; he will therefore defend or at
least explain her various marriages and her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>illegitimate children by different fathers, none
of whom happened to be married to her.</p>

<p class='c003'>Mr. Shaw’s sole contribution to our knowledge
of Shakespeare is the coupling of him
with Dickens, which is very much the same
thing as if one tried to explain Titian by
coupling him with Hogarth. This, in my
opinion, is Mr. Shaw’s only original observation
on the subject, and its perfect originality I
should be the last to deny.</p>

<p class='c003'>I have not yet read or seen Mr. Shaw’s play:
I only wish here to draw attention to the fact
that he has already annexed a good deal of my
work and put it forth as his own, giving me
only the most casual and grudging mention.
From the larger acknowledgment in <i>The
Observer</i>, I naturally infer that in this new
play he has taken from me even more than
he could hope to pass off as his own.</p>

<p class='c003'>All this in the England of to-day is looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>upon as honourable and customary. If Mr.
Shaw can annex my work it only shows that
he is stronger than I am or abler, and this fact
in itself would be generally held to absolve and
justify him: <i>vae victis</i> is the noble English
motto in such cases. But if it turns out in the
long struggle that Mr. Shaw is only more
successful for the moment than I am, if
my books and writings on Shakespeare have
come to stay, then I can safely leave the task
of judging Mr. Shaw to the future.</p>

<p class='c003'>In any case I can console myself. It amused
me years ago to see Mr. Shaw using scraps of
my garments to cover his nakedness; he now
struts about wearing my livery unashamed. I
am delighted that so little of it makes him a
complete suit. My wardrobe is still growing
in spite of his predatory instincts, and he is
welcome to as much of it as I have cast off and
he can cut to fit.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>But is this the best that Mr. Shaw can do with
his astonishing quickness and his admirable
gift of lucid, vigorous speech? Will he, who is
not poor, always be under our tables for the
crumbs? Why should he not share the feast,
or, better still, make a feast of his own? Why
does he not take himself in hand, and crush
the virtue out of himself and distil it into some
noble draught? The quintessence of Shaw
would be worth having.</p>

<p class='c003'>I can afford on this matter to be wholly frank
and ingenuous, and admit that I am gratified
by the ability of my first disciples. Any writer
might be proud of having convinced men of
original minds like Mr. Arnold Bennett, Mr.
Richard Middleton, and Mr. Bernard Shaw of
the truth of a theory so contrary to tradition
as mine is and so contemptuous of authority:
Shakespeare himself would have been proud of
such admirers. And if Mr. Bernard Shaw has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>done his best to share in the honour of the discovery,
one must attribute his excess of zeal to
the intensity of his admiration, and to the fact
that he was perhaps even a little quicker than
the others to appreciate the new view, or
perhaps a little vainer even than most able men.
In any case, Mr. Shaw’s method of dealing with
a new master must be contrasted with that of the
professor who also annexed as much as he
could of my early articles, and coolly asserted
that he had had my ideas ten years before,
leaving it to be inferred that he had concealed
them carefully.</p>

<p class='c003'>After all, the chief thing is, here is my play,
and Mr. Shaw’s will shortly make its appearance,
and in time a true deliverance and judgment
on the respective merits of them will be
forthcoming.</p>

<p class='c003'>A few words about this play of mine may be
allowed me. It suffers from an extraordinary, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>perhaps extravagant, piety: I did not set out to
write a great play on the subject. I wanted to give
a dramatic picture of Shakespeare and his time;
but above all a true picture. It seemed to me
that no one had the right to treat the life-story,
the soul-tragedy of a Shakespeare as the mere
stuff of a play. Within the limits of the truth,
however, I did my best. The play, therefore,
as a play is full of faults: it is as loosely put
together as one of Shakespeare’s own history
plays, and the worst fault of it is not poverty
of plot and weakness of construction; it is also
academic and literary in tone. Much of this is
due to my love of the master. I have hardly put
a word in Shakespeare’s mouth which I could
not justify out of his plays or sonnets. My
excessive love of the man has been a hindrance
to me as a playwright.</p>

<p class='c003'>I daresay—in fact, I am sure—that it would
be possible to write a great play on the subject,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>and tell even more of the truth than I have
here told; but that could only be done if one
knew that the play would be played and had
leisure and encouragement to do one’s best.
The evil of our present civilisation, from the
artist’s point of view, is that he is compelled by
the conditions to give of his second best, and
be thankful if even this is lucky enough to earn
him a living wage.</p>

<p class='c003'>My book on Shakespeare was many years
in type before it found a publisher; my
Shakespeare play was printed six years ago
and has not yet been acted.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>I know not. As youth passes we see things

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Women! You sensitive child.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Violet</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Not a child when I think of you. I used to
look at myself and imagine that some day a man

of me, and I wondered whether I should like it;

touch a man. But now, I love to be near you;
my King, how good it is to be with you. But

<p class='c003'>How kind you are! What a pity you don’t

<p class='c003'>Portia?</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Violet</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>[<i>Rouses herself.</i>] Yes, Portia. Who were you
thinking of when you described Portia? She’s
one of your new friends, I suppose, one of the
great Court ladies. H’m! They’re no better

but now talking with Kempe, the clown. Ladies,
indeed! trulls would behave better.</p>

<p class='c003'>My gentle Violet, in a rage.</p>

<p class='c003'>Oh, they make me angry. Why can’t they be
noble? I mean pure and sweet and gentle,

like those women did to-day. Was Portia one
of them?</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>No, Violet, no. I meant Portia to be a great
lady. Her carriage and manner I took from
someone I once saw at a distance—a passing
glance: but the wit and spirit I had no model
for, none.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Violet</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>You will love one of them, I know. Perhaps,
by speaking of it, I put the thought into your
head, and bring the danger nearer; but I cannot
help it.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Love is its torment.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Violet</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Oh, dear, dear! You will not leave me altogether,
will you? Even if you love her, you will
let me see you sometimes. No one will ever
love you as I do. I only love myself because you
like me, and when you leave me, I’ll fall out of
conceit with my face, and hate it. Hateful face,
that could not please my lord.</p>

known to all that Lady Rutland and Lady Jane

new come to the Globe. Ladies, this is Master
Burbage, who counterfeits kings with such
nobility, and lovers with such reverence, that
ladies lend him their lips in either part. And this
is gentle Shakespeare, the wittiest of poets,
whose sugared verses make all in love with
sweets. And this is Master Chettle, playwright
and Prince of Laughter. Here, too, is grave
young Selden, and Masters Fletcher, Dekker,
Marston, the glories of our stage.</p>

I swear when he takes the floor in the <i>Coranto</i>

<p class='c003'>I’ll believe it sooner than I confess I do; for I

<p class='c003'>Then I shall win you, sweet!</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Miss Fitton</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Perhaps: all women want to love and be loved.
Men desire beauty, wealth, power, honours; we

<p class='c003'>You must never make me jealous. Heal that at

<p class='c003'>Whom are you talking about?</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Lacy</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Is it a secret? The dark lady, then, has her
rival in the fair maid, and courage and wit on the

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Lacy</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Ha, ha! Now, if I had believed a man’s oaths
how I should hate myself. But, thank Heaven!
I was not befooled by his vows and protestations.
The player may go to his trull, some orange-girl,
I suppose, and brag; but, thank God! I am not
his dupe. Violet, indeed!         [<i>Laughs.</i>]</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Lacy</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Do not be hasty-rash: I know nothing; she may

<p class='c003'>You would have me a credulous fool: a laughing-stock
for the player and his patch. No, no!
I am schooled in time. Who stoops, suffers: the
man who would win me, must have no Violet.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Lacy</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>It is nobler to trust too much than too little.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Miss Fitton</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Story?</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Herbert</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>The story that made you all laugh as I came in.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Lady Cynthia</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>There was no story.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Herbert</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>It was truth, you mean. [<i>Lady Cynthia

it?</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Lady Cynthia</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Why should you think it was about you?</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Herbert</span>:</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Miss Fitton</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Of course they will; women always tell of each
other, so I’ll save them the trouble. Lady Cynthia

the Captain you struck.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Lady Cynthia</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Oh, I didn’t, I didn’t. I’ll never forgive you,

<p class='c003'>And would you be the Queen, lady?</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Miss Fitton</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Perhaps; for women can win, though conquered.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Herbert</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Then conquest does not frighten you?</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span><span class='sc'>Miss Fitton</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Nothing frightens us but indifference. We

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Herbert</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Double proof?</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Miss Fitton</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Yes: you strike a Captain of thirty, and kiss a

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Miss Fitton</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>[<i>Holding her head away.</i>] That were to turn

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Lacy</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>If I intrude, I flex the knee: I’m sage-green

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Herbert</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>[<i>Irritably.</i>] I wish you’d talk naturally, like a

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Lacy</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>In verity I belong to the brutish, bearded
sex, as you may prove, my lord, when the
occasion pleases you. [<i>Bows to Herbert.</i>] But
“naturally” offends my sense, ’tis a gross and
vulgar birth. Prithee, my lord, do you dress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“naturally”? or eat “naturally”? or house
“naturally”? And if to be natural in all these
is savage-vile, why should a man talk “naturally,”
like a lewd barbarian?</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Herbert</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>I mean why be singular in speech—fanciful,
peculiar?</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Lacy</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>The first man who made a girdle of skins instead
of the fig-leaf was so admonished, and with
equal consistency. Why wear a slashed doublet,
my lord—most “fanciful-peculiar”?</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Herbert</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>It becomes my place.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Lacy</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>And so my speech is more ornate than peasants
use.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Herbert</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>But my doublet isn’t tagged with silly, useless
ornaments, like your “scent the air,” and “sage-green

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span><span class='sc'>Lacy</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Green means nothing; but sage-green paints
the bilious tinge of soured vanity; still, a dispute
about the shade concedes the principle.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Herbert</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>No, I think the common speech better, stronger.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Lacy</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>No! No! Ten thousand negatives! I abhor
your common fustian speech. Words, like coins,
grow lighter in the using; so I mint a new word
to charm the ear, as a jeweller sets a gem to catch
the eye. [<i>Turning to Miss Fitton.</i>] But I’ve
tired you, most divine fair, with peevish argument,

That’s Chettle’s art. Ben has no kindling fancy,

lads, a rich secret, a secret of gold; in this world
large promises excite more goodwill than small
performances, and praise to a woman is more
than sacks of money. He! he! Oh, the sweet

<p class='c003'>No, bully boy, no: I’ve never been rich enough
to keep a conscience: never! With us poor devils
conscience is like a court-suit put by for state
occasions and then used as little as may be: we
pawn it sometimes for a dinner. Conscience, look
ye, is a jade that still cries “No, no!” and never
helps with brave encouragement: a good defender
of the rich; but a born foe of the poor, laming
enterprise. No, no, lad, no conscience for me; a
bad one’s worse than a belly-ache, and with a
good one I’d starve. Conscience is like a shrewish
wife (have I touched ye there, Ben?), as long as
you listen to her she makes you miserable, and
when you no longer care for her, why should you
keep her? To conclude: Conscience, boys, is a
bogey to frighten the feeble from frolic. Ha ha!</p>

and orange-girls out of their crosses with a bad
play when they’ve paid to hear a good ’un, and I
cheat by giving soft words instead of coins. And
the conclusion! The girls are angry with you,
while my hostess is in love with me. True virtue
is good-humour, Ben: and a pleasant smile’s more
than all the commandments.</p>

<p class='c003'>I was waiting there to-day; but you are very
late, and one cannot play sentinel for ever. Have
you heard the news? No! Lady Joan instead of
curing Lacy, has caught his trick of speech, and

roaring.</p>

<p class='c003'>You are incorrigible!</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Herbert</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>I am. How can I help it? I can’t love the rose

and free, you lean your head upon my breast, and
the mother in me makes me your slave; my blood

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>[<i>Stopping in front of him.</i>] Love lives on love,
Ben; the less she gives me the less I crave.
When I saw her every day it was too little, and

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>[<i>Stops in front of him.</i>] Is it love or hate?
Sometimes I hate her—sometimes she is coarse
to me, obstinate and vain, soulless as a drab,
sometimes [<i>Puts his hands to his face.</i>] the rose of
women. [<i>Throws himself in a seat.</i>] I pass my
time in waiting for her, thinking of her: I am
degraded into a brute-desire. She writes, “I will
be with you in an hour,” that is three hours
agone; she is not here yet, and may not come
to-day; damn her!</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Jonson</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Why don’t you work; put her out of mind:

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Forget! work! That is the worst of her, she
kills my work, and yet she quickens life in me.
When we sacrifice ourselves for some one, Ben;
when we give too much; we grow to hate her!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>... Is it not shameful of her to tease me
so? [<i>Goes to window again and looks out.</i>] The

<p class='c003'>It might take long. But I like you better as

<p class='c003'>Do you! Ah! [<i>Putting his head back.</i>] If you
knew the maddening hours I spend, longing,
waiting, hoping, fearing, you would pity me.
There is a martyrdom in love. I live in purgatory;
burning now with hell’s fevers, and now my fiend
comes and my dungeon, flame-lit, is more lovely-fair
than Heaven. When you have gone the air
will sing of you; I close my eyes and hear the
rustle of your garments, and [<i>putting his hands to

your beauty. [<i>He buries his face in her dress, then
rises gravely.</i>] You once said love would keep
love; I love you, Mary, to madness.</p>

let my eyes feed on you. [<i>Miss Fitton sits near
him.</i>] Strange; you are more desirable now than
when I first knew you. Then I saw faults in you;
now your faults all sharpen appetite. As I look
at you it all comes back—that first day in Whitehall
when the morning air was warm like milk
and the wavelets danced in the sun. Do you
remember how we sat and kissed, each kiss
longer than the last? [<i>Mistress Fitton bows her</i>

spot by the river—I was alone and desolate—but
of a sudden you came—[<i>she turns to him in
wonder</i>] yourself, of grace and pride compounded,
like a queen, and I touched your hair, and every
separate hair a sin of multiple desire; I drew
down your face and your lips clung and kissed as
no lips ever kissed before. Then of a sudden you
were gone, and I was awake—alone. Since then
I have prayed to go mad again, to hold you, and
so be mad for ever, lips on lips——[<i>Mistress
Fitton rises.</i>] What are you doing?</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Miss Fitton</span>:</p>

Stratford. The master is seated in a large chair
close to the bed. A small table stands near the
head of the bed. His daughter Judith is in the

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Jonson</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>[<i>Going quietly to bed.</i>] We came to see you,
Shakespeare, before we return to town.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Drayton</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>We were so sorry to hear you were ill. But
what’s the matter?</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>My joy at seeing you both: the cup of wine
last night; our great talk—have set the old candle
guttering.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span><span class='sc'>Jonson</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>It isn’t what you drank; you were most
temperate.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>I have poor unhappy brains for drinking: one
cup, you know, was always too much for me.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Drayton</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>It must have been the talk, Shakespeare; you
drank nothing. But I never dreamt you were so
weak; you used to seem strong enough.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>I was never strong, I think. Even as a youth
any excitement robbed me of sleep and made me
fanciful, and of late years I have only been well
when very quiet—when the thin flame is lanterned
from every breath [<i>with a gesture</i>]. But what
matters it? If the candle goes out there’s an end.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Jonson</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>I blame myself for having overtired you. But
you talked wonderfully—as no one ever talked
before, I think, and I could not pull you up; now
I blame myself.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span><span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>There’s no blame possible. It was a great
night; one of the greatest nights of my life. But
give me more news: I seem to have heard
nothing; are the boy-players still followed?</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Drayton</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>No: the fashion’s changed. There’s some
talk of having girl-actresses to play the girls’
parts on the stage, as they do in France.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Jonson</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>A mad proposal. It would bring the theatre
into worse repute than ever, and give the Puritans
a handle for attack.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>[<i>Smiling.</i>] The pretty children! Now at sixteen
they all wish to be nuns or nursing sisters: then
they would not know whether to be nuns or actresses,
and they would be sure to confuse the
duties: if they acted they’d try to do good to
their hearers, and if they tended the sick they
would want pretty dresses and a crowd of spectators
to admire their devotion.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Jonson</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Ha, ha! Excellent.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span><span class='sc'>Drayton</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Come to London soon, Shakespeare. We all
miss our gentle peacemaker and his wit.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>[<i>With deprecating gesture.</i>] Tell me everything.
Are there any new poets, new theatres? Do the
Puritans disturb you? Here in my house my
daughter puts preachers to lodge as soon as I go
away for a week or so: to purge the air, I suppose,
of my sinful presence.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Jonson</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>There’s no great change. Pembroke is in

<p class='c003'><span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>No need for grief. Our life is but a breath—
A rack of smoke that at the topmost height
Dislimns and fades away.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Jonson</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>Mary—Mary Fitton. A great woman.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Drayton</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>And beautiful!</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>When she left me my hopes went down for
ever. Strange! At first I didn’t suffer much;
it’s the scratches hurt, not the death-wound; but
as the years went on I suffered: it was always ill
with me here about my heart—</p>

<p class='c003'>Yet I see now she was a wonderful piece of

<p class='c003'>And Pembroke? He didn’t touch you so
nearly?</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>No. His was the poison of daily life; the
small, hard nature, the low betrayal. It was
well to forget him. But she was too great to be
forgotten. There was something immortal in
her, and I loved her.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Jonson</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>I wonder you did not kill them both.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>:</p>

<p class='c003'>No, no, Jonson: that is your nature, your
violent nature. We all must suffer through the
best in us: the mother through her child; the
lover through his love; the wise through his
wisdom—these are the growing pains of our

</div>

<p class='c003'>“By far the most original, suggestive, and brilliantly conceived
writing on Shakespeare that our times have known, or are likely
to know.”—<i>The Nation.</i></p>

<p class='c003'>“Nobody who cares for fine literature, however indifferent he
may be to Mr. Harris’s main thesis, should pass this book by.
As a thesis we call it a brilliant and fascinating <i>tour de force</i>.
As a book concerned with the greatest poetry we assign to it
critical merit of the first order. In both aspects we predict for
it a permanent importance.”—<i>The Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p class='c003'>“This work appears to us the most original and, in some
ways, the most illuminating criticism of Shakespeare that has
ever been written.”—<i>The Westminster Gazette.</i></p>

<p class='c003'>“Mr. Harris has written a book with which all students of the
Shakespeare mystery will have to deal; he has opened a line of
study that was practically unknown.”—<i>The Outlook.</i></p>

<p class='c003'>“It must have been Tolstoi who inspired Mr. Frank Harris to
write this brilliant, this amazingly ingenious book on Shakespeare....
This is a splendid, even a magnetic book written
with a magnetic inspiration.”—<i>The Observer.</i></p>

<p class='c003'>“A very remarkable contribution to our knowledge about Shakespeare.”—<span class='sc'>W.

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“We rejoice to see published in an independent volume Mr.
Arnold Bennett’s stirring and mordant play, ‘What the Public
Wants,’ which we noticed here on its first production in London.
It is far the best—indeed, the only very good—modern English
play with a subject drawn from the life of journalism. And,
unlike some plays that act well, it is uncommonly good reading.”—<i>The
Manchester Guardian.</i></p>

<p class='c003'>“It reads even better than it played, and it is hard to put it
down until one has come to the end. It is also very nicely printed
and bound.”—<i>The Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

    <div class='c006'>By ARNOLD BENNETT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“Though neither so interesting or so important as the play
itself, the introduction by which Mr. Bennett prefaces his work
is a discourse full of pointed remarks about the present state
of the drama, the bad business of which all theatrical managers
complain, the inexhaustible growth in the younger generation
of new expectations from the theatre, and the promise of new
spirit in play-writing. Mr. Bennett holds that the boards of the
future will belong to those who follow in the wake of Mr. Bernard
Shaw. His piece, accordingly, an ably-constructed, well-observed,
interesting and thoughtful play of four acts, in plain, modern
prose, without any sort of smart dialogue, other theatrical ornaments,
treats its theme as that writer might be expected to treat
it were he less witty and less ironical than at his best he is....
The play reads well, and reads as if it would prove still more
effective and enjoyable when acted. The stage would be healthier
if such pieces were more commonly to be seen there than they
are.”—<i>The Scotsman.</i></p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
